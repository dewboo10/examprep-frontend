        <div class="question-title"><span class="toggle-arrow">▶</span>1. 60% of a number is equal to 3/5 of another number. If the first number is 150, what is the second number?</div>
        <div class="answer-block"><b>Answer:</b> 150<br><b>Explanation:</b><br>
- <b>Step 1:</b> 60% of the first number means 60/100 × 150 = 90.<br>
- <b>Step 2:</b> Let the second number be x. 3/5 of x = 90.<br>
- <b>Step 3:</b> To find x, set up the equation: (3/5)x = 90.<br>
- <b>Step 4:</b> Multiply both sides by 5: 3x = 450.<br>
- <b>Step 5:</b> Divide both sides by 3: x = 150.<br>
- <b>Conclusion:</b> The second number is 150.

        <div class="question-title"><span class="toggle-arrow">▶</span>2. If A is 25% more than B, then B is what percent less than A?</div>
        <div class="answer-block"><b>Answer:</b> 20%<br><b>Explanation:</b><br>
- <b>Step 1:</b> Let B = 100 (choose a simple value for easier calculation).<br>
- <b>Step 2:</b> A is 25% more than B, so A = 100 + 25 = 125.<br>
- <b>Step 3:</b> The difference between A and B is 25.<br>
- <b>Step 4:</b> To find what percent B is less than A, use the formula:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Percent less = (Difference / A) × 100 = (25 / 125) × 100 = 20%.<br>
- <b>Conclusion:</b> B is 20% less than A.

        <div class="answer-block"><b>Answer:</b> 9% decrease<br><b>Explanation:</b><br>
- <b>Step 1:</b> Let the original number be 100.<br>
- <b>Step 2:</b> Increase by 30%: 100 + 30 = 130.<br>
- <b>Step 3:</b> Decrease 130 by 30%: 130 - (30% of 130) = 130 - 39 = 91.<br>
- <b>Step 4:</b> Net change = Final value - Original value = 91 - 100 = -9.<br>
- <b>Step 5:</b> Net percentage change = (-9 / 100) × 100 = -9%.<br>
- <b>Formula used:</b> Net % change = a + b + (ab/100), where a = 30, b = -30.<br>
- <b>Conclusion:</b> The net change is a 9% decrease.

        <div class="answer-block"><b>Answer:</b> 25<br><b>Explanation:</b><br>
- <b>Step 1:</b> 0.5% means 0.5 per 100.<br>
- <b>Step 2:</b> To find 0.5% of 5000, use the formula:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Value = (Percentage / 100) × Number = (0.5 / 100) × 5000.<br>
- <b>Step 3:</b> (0.5 / 100) = 0.005.<br>
- <b>Step 4:</b> 0.005 × 5000 = 25.<br>
- <b>Conclusion:</b> 0.5% of 5000 is 25.

        <div class="answer-block"><b>Answer:</b> 80%<br><b>Explanation:</b><br>
- <b>Step 1:</b> To find what percent of 80 is 64, use the formula:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Percent = (Part / Whole) × 100.<br>
- <b>Step 2:</b> Here, Part = 64, Whole = 80.<br>
- <b>Step 3:</b> (64 / 80) × 100 = 0.8 × 100 = 80%.<br>
- <b>Conclusion:</b> 64 is 80% of 80.

- <b>Step 1:</b> Let the original number be 100.<br>
- <b>Step 2:</b> Decrease by 20%: 100 - 20 = 80.<br>
- <b>Step 3:</b> To get back to 100 from 80, increase by (100 - 80) = 20.<br>
- <b>Step 4:</b> Required percent increase = (20 / 80) × 100 = 25%.<br>

- <b>Step 1:</b> Let the number be x.<br>
- <b>Step 2:</b> 40% of x = 96.<br>
- <b>Step 3:</b> Write as equation: (40/100) × x = 96.<br>

- <b>Step 1:</b> Let the original price be P.<br>
- <b>Step 2:</b> After markup: P × (1 + x/100).<br>
- <b>Step 3:</b> After x% discount: P × (1 + x/100) × (1 - x/100) = P × (1 - x²/10000).<br>

- <b>Step 1:</b> Let the original consumption be 100 units.<br>
- <b>Step 2:</b> Original price per unit = P, so total spend = 100P.<br>
- <b>Step 3:</b> New price per unit = 1.5P.<br>

- <b>Step 5:</b> Let new consumption = x units.<br>
- <b>Step 6:</b> 1.5P × x = 110P → x = 110P / 1.5P = 73.33 units.<br>

        <div class="answer-block"><b>Detailed Explanation:</b><br>
- <b>Step 1:</b> Let the total income be x.<br>
- <b>Step 2:</b> Tax on first ₹4500 = 20% of 4500 = ₹900.<br>
- <b>Step 3:</b> Tax on next ₹3000 = 25% of 3000 = ₹750.<br>
- <b>Step 4:</b> Remaining income = x - 7500. Tax on this = 30% of (x - 7500) = 0.3(x - 7500).<br>
- <b>Step 5:</b> Total tax paid = 900 + 750 + 0.3(x - 7500) = 1650 + 0.3x - 2250 = 0.3x - 600.<br>

        <div class="answer-block"><b>Detailed Explanation:</b><br>
- <b>Step 1:</b> Let A have a guavas, B have b guavas.<br>
- <b>Step 2:</b> A gives 25% to B: A has 0.75a, B has b + 0.25a. 0.75a = b + 0.25a + 2 ⇒ 0.5a - b = 2.<br>
- <b>Step 3:</b> B gives 70% to A: B has 0.3b, A has a + 0.7b. 0.3b = a + 0.7b + 4 ⇒ -a - 0.4b = 4.<br>
- <b>Step 4:</b> From step 2: b = 0.5a - 2. Substitute into step 3: -a - 0.4(0.5a - 2) = 4 ⇒ -a - 0.2a + 0.8 = 4 ⇒ -1.2a = 3.2 ⇒ a = -2.67 (not possible, so check logic).<br>
- <b>Step 5:</b> Corrected: B gives 70% to A, so A has a - 0.7b, B has b + 0.7b = 1.7b. 1.7b = a - 0.7b + 4 ⇒ 2.4b - a = 4.<br>
- <b>Step 6:</b> Now, b = 0.5a - 2. Substitute: 2.4(0.5a - 2) - a = 4 ⇒ 1.2a - 4.8 - a = 4 ⇒ 0.2a = 8.8 ⇒ a = 44, b = 0.5 × 44 - 2 = 20.<br>

        <div class="answer-block"><b>Detailed Explanation:</b><br>
- <b>Step 1:</b> Let others increase by x%.<br>
- <b>Step 2:</b> Index rise: 0.07 × 9 + 0.13 × 10 + 0.15 × 4 + 0.65 × x = 6.<br>
- <b>Step 3:</b> 0.63 + 1.3 + 0.6 + 0.65x = 6 ⇒ 2.53 + 0.65x = 6 ⇒ 0.65x = 3.47 ⇒ x ≈ 5.34.

        <div class="answer-block"><b>Detailed Explanation:</b><br>
- <b>Step 1:</b> Normal = 0.01%. Current = 20%. Each day, pollution reduces by 80%, so remaining = 20%.<br>
- <b>Step 2:</b> Need 20% × (0.2)^n ≤ 0.01%.<br>
- <b>Step 3:</b> (0.2)^{n+1} ≤ 10^{-4}. Take logs: (n+1) log(0.2) ≤ -4 ⇒ n+1 ≥ -4 / log(0.2) ≈ 5.72 ⇒ n ≥ 4.72, so 5 days.

- <b>Step 1:</b> Let English = E, Maths = 1.5E, Science = S, Hindi = H.<br>
- <b>Step 2:</b> S - H = 48.<br>
- <b>Step 3:</b> Total marks: E + 1.5E + S + H = 4 × 64 = 256.<br>
- <b>Step 4:</b> Adding 50% of English: 256 + 0.5E = 4 × 70 = 280 ⇒ 0.5E = 24 ⇒ E = 48.<br>
- <b>Step 5:</b> 2.5E + S + H = 256 ⇒ 120 + S + H = 256 ⇒ S + H = 136.<br>

        <div class="answer-block"><b>Detailed Explanation:</b><br>
- <b>Step 1:</b> First year: P × r = 15 ⇒ P = 15/r.<br>
- <b>Step 2:</b> Second year principal: P + 15 + 85 = P + 100.<br>
- <b>Step 3:</b> Second year amount: (P + 100)(1 + r) = 420.<br>
- <b>Step 4:</b> Substitute P = 15/r: (15/r + 100)(1 + r) = 420.<br>
- <b>Step 5:</b> Expand: 15/r + 15 + 100 + 100r = 420 ⇒ 15/r + 100r = 305.<br>
- <b>Step 6:</b> Multiply by r: 15 + 100r^2 = 305r ⇒ 100r^2 - 305r + 15 = 0.<br>
- <b>Step 7:</b> Solve quadratic: r = [305 ± sqrt(305^2 - 6000)] / 200 = [305 ± 295] / 200 ⇒ r = 3 or 0.05. r = 5% is valid.<br>

        <div class="answer-block"><b>Detailed Explanation:</b><br>
- <b>Step 1:</b> Profit sharing ratio = investment ratio. Let investments: A + B + C = 70,000.<br>

- <b>Step 3:</b> Binit's profit share: 0.6B.<br>
- <b>Step 4:</b> Amul's interest: 0.6A × (1.1^2 - 1) = 2520 ⇒ 0.6A × 0.21 = 2520 ⇒ A = 2520 / 0.126 = 20,000.<br>
