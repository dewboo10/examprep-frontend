        <div class="question-title"><span class="toggle-arrow">▶</span>1. 60% of a number is equal to 3/5 of another number. If the first number is 150, what is the second number?</div>
        <div class="answer-block"><b>Answer:</b> 150<br><b>Explanation:</b><br>
- <b>Step 1:</b> 60% of the first number means 60/100 × 150 = 90.<br>
- <b>Step 2:</b> Let the second number be x. 3/5 of x = 90.<br>
- <b>Step 3:</b> To find x, set up the equation: (3/5)x = 90.<br>
- <b>Step 4:</b> Multiply both sides by 5: 3x = 450.<br>
- <b>Step 5:</b> Divide both sides by 3: x = 150.<br>
- <b>Conclusion:</b> The second number is 150.

        <div class="question-title"><span class="toggle-arrow">▶</span>2. If A is 25% more than B, then B is what percent less than A?</div>
        <div class="answer-block"><b>Answer:</b> 20%<br><b>Explanation:</b><br>
- <b>Step 1:</b> Let B = 100 (choose a simple value for easier calculation).<br>
- <b>Step 2:</b> A is 25% more than B, so A = 100 + 25 = 125.<br>
- <b>Step 3:</b> The difference between A and B is 25.<br>
- <b>Step 4:</b> To find what percent B is less than A, use the formula:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Percent less = (Difference / A) × 100 = (25 / 125) × 100 = 20%.<br>
- <b>Conclusion:</b> B is 20% less than A.

        <div class="answer-block"><b>Answer:</b> 9% decrease<br><b>Explanation:</b><br>
- <b>Step 1:</b> Let the original number be 100.<br>
- <b>Step 2:</b> Increase by 30%: 100 + 30 = 130.<br>
- <b>Step 3:</b> Decrease 130 by 30%: 130 - (30% of 130) = 130 - 39 = 91.<br>
- <b>Step 4:</b> Net change = Final value - Original value = 91 - 100 = -9.<br>
- <b>Step 5:</b> Net percentage change = (-9 / 100) × 100 = -9%.<br>
- <b>Formula used:</b> Net % change = a + b + (ab/100), where a = 30, b = -30.<br>
- <b>Conclusion:</b> The net change is a 9% decrease.

        <div class="answer-block"><b>Answer:</b> 25<br><b>Explanation:</b><br>
- <b>Step 1:</b> 0.5% means 0.5 per 100.<br>
- <b>Step 2:</b> To find 0.5% of 5000, use the formula:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Value = (Percentage / 100) × Number = (0.5 / 100) × 5000.<br>
- <b>Step 3:</b> (0.5 / 100) = 0.005.<br>
- <b>Step 4:</b> 0.005 × 5000 = 25.<br>
- <b>Conclusion:</b> 0.5% of 5000 is 25.

        <div class="answer-block"><b>Answer:</b> 80%<br><b>Explanation:</b><br>
- <b>Step 1:</b> To find what percent of 80 is 64, use the formula:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Percent = (Part / Whole) × 100.<br>
- <b>Step 2:</b> Here, Part = 64, Whole = 80.<br>
- <b>Step 3:</b> (64 / 80) × 100 = 0.8 × 100 = 80%.<br>
- <b>Conclusion:</b> 64 is 80% of 80.

- <b>Step 1:</b> Let the original number be 100.<br>
- <b>Step 2:</b> Decrease by 20%: 100 - 20 = 80.<br>
- <b>Step 3:</b> To get back to 100 from 80, increase by (100 - 80) = 20.<br>
- <b>Step 4:</b> Required percent increase = (20 / 80) × 100 = 25%.<br>

- <b>Step 1:</b> Let the number be x.<br>
- <b>Step 2:</b> 40% of x = 96.<br>
- <b>Step 3:</b> Write as equation: (40/100) × x = 96.<br>

- <b>Step 1:</b> Let the original consumption be 100 units.<br>
