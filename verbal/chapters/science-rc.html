                            <p>Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. This complex process involves multiple steps and various cellular components. The primary site of photosynthesis is the chloroplast, which contains the green pigment chlorophyll.</p>
                            <p>The process begins when light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules. This energy is used to split water molecules, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. The energy from this reaction is then used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.</p>

                            <p>The human nervous system is a complex network of specialized cells that coordinate body activities. It consists of two main parts: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS includes the brain and spinal cord, while the PNS consists of nerves that connect the CNS to the rest of the body.</p>
                            <p>Neurons, the basic units of the nervous system, transmit electrical signals called action potentials. These signals travel along the neuron's axon and are transmitted to other neurons through specialized junctions called synapses. The transmission of signals between neurons involves both electrical and chemical processes.</p>
                            <p>Neurotransmitters, chemical messengers released at synapses, play a crucial role in signal transmission. Different neurotransmitters have different effects on target cells, influencing various bodily functions from muscle movement to emotional responses.</p>

                            <p>Evolution by natural selection is a fundamental concept in biology that explains how species change over time. The process involves three key components: variation within populations, inheritance of traits, and differential survival and reproduction.</p>
                            <p>Genetic mutations provide the raw material for evolution, creating variations in traits. These variations can be beneficial, harmful, or neutral to an organism's survival and reproduction. Over generations, beneficial traits become more common in the population, while harmful traits become less common.</p>
                            <p>Natural selection acts on these variations, favoring traits that enhance survival and reproduction in a given environment. This process can lead to the development of new species through a process called speciation, where populations become genetically distinct from their ancestors.</p>

The theory is based on two fundamental principles: the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion, and the speed of light is constant regardless of the observer's motion.</p>
                            <p>One of the most famous consequences of special relativity is the equation E=mc², which shows the equivalence of mass and energy. This relationship has profound implications for nuclear physics and our understanding of the universe.</p>

                            <p>Electromagnetic waves are a form of energy that can travel through space. They consist of oscillating electric and magnetic fields that are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of wave propagation. The electromagnetic spectrum includes various types of waves, from radio waves to gamma rays, differing in wavelength and frequency.</p>
                            <p>The speed of electromagnetic waves in a vacuum is constant, approximately 3 × 10⁸ meters per second. This speed is known as the speed of light.
