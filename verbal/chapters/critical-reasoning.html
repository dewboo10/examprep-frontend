                    <p class="text-green-600 font-semibold">Correct Answer: B) Students who sleep less than eight hours a day perform poorly in exams.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">This is the key assumption in the argument. The conclusion assumes that less sleep leads to poor performance, which is necessary to justify the recommendation.</p>
